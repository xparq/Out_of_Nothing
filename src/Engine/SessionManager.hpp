	The use of the word "session" is NOT limited to the saved state itself,
	but models the entire run-time context of a... well: session..., possibly
	even shared by multiple simultaneous users, and serverd by multiple hosts.

	Some (especially shared) sessions may not even be possible to save -- only
	record -- meaningfully. (The difference being: saving is for continuing a
	session, while recording only preserves (certain forms of) data history,
	mainly for analysis or entertainment (e.g. playback) purposes.)
