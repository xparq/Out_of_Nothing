# Yeah, this does nothing for Git... Just leaving here as a reminder.
# I just force-added these files:
!tooling/edit/vscodium/user-data-dir/User/settings.json
!tooling/edit/vscodium/user-data-dir/User/keybindings.json
!tooling/edit/vscodium/user-data-dir/User/extensions.json

# Too much legacy gunk currently, so keep them ignored:

**/sound/music/*
# Ditto (as with the VSCode junk): not the way to "ignore, except these..." with Git:
!**/sound/music/README.*
!**/sound/music/default.ogg

#!! This fkn thing again doesn't do what's expected, I'm tired of it...
