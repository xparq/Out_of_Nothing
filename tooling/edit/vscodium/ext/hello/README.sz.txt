I've had an exhaustive chat with GPT about this (that's also where
this ext. stub came from), but stopped listening at the part where
I was supposed to first of all get and make npm available here, and
then set up a repo here, inside the ext dir..., and then the npx
src -> dist autocompiler bullshit, separately...

I need to dbl-check if there's a less roundabout way to just write
a f* macro for VS Code, before coming to terms with how f* decadent
this toolchain is...
