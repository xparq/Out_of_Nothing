I've had an exhaustive chat with GPT about this (that's alsow here
this ext. stub came from), but stopped listening at the part where
i was supposed to first of all get and make npm available here, and
then set up a repo here, inside the ext dir... And then the npx
src-> dist autocompiler bullshit, separately...

I need to dbl-check if there's a less roundabout way to just write
a f* macro for Code.
