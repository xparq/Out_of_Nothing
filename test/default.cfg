# NOTES:
#
# - Paths are typically relative to some base dir depending on context
#   (unless they're absolute). Those starting with ./ are always relative
#   to the current dir, of course. The ../ ones are not, though.)
#
# - Text strings must also be quoted, in general (even is redundant). :-/
# - Backslashes in paths might fail, even if quoted! :-/ Use fw. slashes only!
